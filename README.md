# Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in College Campus using Edge AI

## Overview
This project utilizes Edge AI to provide detailed insights into vehicle movement and parking behaviors on college campuses. By leveraging real-time image processing and data analytics, the solution aims to optimize campus management and enhance security measures.

For a comprehensive understanding of our solution, including detailed descriptions of the solutionâ€™s features, process flow, and architecture, please refer to our [Project Report](https://github.com/Hrishikesh-Papasani/Campus-vehicle-movement-edge-ai/blob/main/Project_Report.pdf). The report provides in-depth insights into our methodologies, technical implementations, and future directions for our vehicle movement analysis and insight generation project on college campuses.

## Key Features
- **Vehicle Movement Analysis**: Analyzes the movement patterns of vehicles to manage campus security effectively.
- **Parking Occupancy Monitoring**: Monitors parking slot availability and occupancy status.
- **Number Plate Detection**: Uses Easy OCR for detecting vehicle number plates and identifying authorized and unauthorized vehicles.
- **Vehicle Counting**: Counts incoming and outgoing vehicles to track traffic flow.
- **Integration with MySQL Database**: Stores and manages data related to vehicle movements and parking slots.
